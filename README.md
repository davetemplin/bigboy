High data-rate SQL-to-JSON extraction from SQL Server, PostgreSQL, or MySQL.

# Overview

Bigboy is basically a **SQL-TO-JSON** tool that extracts data from SQL Server, PostgreSQL, or MySQL databases.
It is designed to handle extremely high data extraction rates (multi-million rows / gigabyte-range) which is achieved by running multiple concurrent extraction queries from a configurable thread pool.
The tool provides a simple configuration model for managing any number of data extractions.
It also exposes a simple and minimal command-line interface (CLI) that works great for adhoc or batch/cron use-cases.

## Features

* Extract data from SQL Server, PostgreSQL, or MySQL
* Perform simple SQL-to-JSON transformations
* Nest rows to form complex hierarchical (or document-oriented) data
* Define configuration parameters to manage dynamic queries
* Run queries in parallel from a configurable thread pool for high data rates
* Combine data from multiple different database sources
* Apply timezone to dates stored without a timezone

> Above defaults can also be configured in the `config.json` file.

## Date Format

All dates are assumed to be in GMT unless a timezone is specified.
If a time is not specified then midnight GMT is assumed.
Examples below illustrate various scenarios of specifying a date or date-range.

The following examples assume there is a target named `log` with a single paramter of type `date` representing a start date for the extraction.

| Example                               | Comments
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bigboy log 2017-07-21`               | 7/21/2017 at midnight GMT
| `bigboy log "2017-07-21 15:00:00"`    | 7/21/2017 at 3pm GMT
| `bigboy log today`                    | Midnight GMT of the current day
| `bigboy log yesterday`                | Midnight GMT of the previous day

The following examples assume there is a target named `sales` with two paramters of type `date` representing a date range for the extraction.

| Example                               | Comments
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bigboy sales 2017-07-21 2017-07-23`  | From 7/21/2017 to 7/23/2017 midnight-to-midnight GMT
| `bigboy sales 2017-07-21 2d`          | Midnight GMT of the previous day.

> The time-zone database needed by LoadLocation may not be present on all systems, especially non-Unix systems. LoadLocation looks in the directory for an uncompressed zip file named by the ZONEINFO environment variable, if any, then looks in known installation locations on Unix systems, and finally looks in $GOROOT/lib/time/zoneinfo.zip.
